    Biggest Tech Issue: Need More Women
  </div>

    <p>The biggest issue facing the tech world is inbalance between men and women at technology companies. The majority of tech companies, and specifically the techical teams like engineering or data science, are primarily male. For example, at my current company there are 4/75 women on the engineering team and 0/5 on data science. It is the biggest problem in the tech world because (1) it leads to fewer women in senior leadership roles, (2) lack of varying perspectives on teams, (3) and women are in lower paid positions within the company. </p>

<p>Within technology companies, it is important to have a firm grasp on the technical aspects of the product in order to move up the ladder. Most CEO's at technology companies are male because of this. In many cases, the men who are in more technical roles, get promoted because of this perseived need. Instead of focusing on interpersonal skills or past achievements. This can limit the career mobility of a woman, who may not possess those (perceived) necessary skills. Thus, it is important for more women to learn more technical skills to move up the latter at tech companies. </p>

<p>Another effect of fewer woman than men in technical roles is the lack of perspective on engineering teams. Most companies are creating products used by women and men, but only have men working on creating the product. As a broad generalization, men to use and interact with products differently than women. Thus it is important for women to be on the engineering team to be a voice for women using a product. It's also important internally to have more women on engineering teams. Women tend to be more thoughtful, thorough and detail-oriented. This results in a stronger product. In all, women need to be in more technical roles to shed another perspective to a team to the benefit of the product. </p>

<p>And finally, technical roles tend to be higher paid so men, on average, tend to be higher paid than their female co-workers in different roles. At my current company, engineers are paid $100,000 starting out, and 98% of those positions are filled by males. In contrast, the account management role is the most popular female role and its starting salary is $60,000. There's huge discrepancy between the pay of the most popular male vs. female role at my company and that trend continues across most other companies. Therefore, it is important for woman to become more balanced with men in these higher paying technical roles. </p>

<p>This imbalance between men and women can be aliviated with the following changes: </p>
<li> encouraging women to study computer science in college</li>
<li> limiting the "boys club" engineering culture within technology companies</li>
<li> helping women less technical roles transition to engineering roles, if they are interested</li>
<li>  providing more state & federal funding for scholorships for women to study computer science</li>
<li>  creating a larger women in technology network (good one in the Bay Area with Women Who Code and Girl Develop It, but not present in all cities)</li>

<p>I think this year is the beginning of a huge shift in women in technology and excited for more programs to be implemented to encourage women to move into the technology industry in technical roles. Excited to be part of the change!</p>
