  <div class="question">
    Have you ever posted on the Google+ community (or elsewhere) and didn't get the answer you needed? Were you frustrated by not receiving a helpful response? Did you review the question and consider why people weren't answering? Did you not give enough information? Was the question asked elsewhere? Was it unclear? Learning how to ask good questions is a necessary skill for success as a developer (especially at DBC). So take a bit of time to research how to ask good questions.

  <div class="answer">
  I think most unhelpful responses from questions are a result of a confusing question. This type of question can have too many elements or be too vague. I have not experienced an unhelpful answer since my questions have all revolved around setting up pairing sessions on Google+. In the past, in a professional environment, I have experienced not having my question answered or answered in a helpful way. The cause of this experience has been (1) not asking a clear question, (2) too many parts of the question, (3) not sending the question to the correct person. I have learned from these experiences, it's important to provide context for your question, i.e. why are you asking the question? And it's important to write a clear and concise question to receive a helpful response.
