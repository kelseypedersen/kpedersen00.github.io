    <p><u>My Key Values</u></p>
    <p>Adventure<br>
    Personal Development<br>
    Self-reliance<br>
    Will-power</p>

    <p> In general, I try to live u p to these values all the time.</p>

    <p>Personal Development is the value that is most important to me. I think it is important to continue to challenge yourself and learn from your mistakes to become a stronger person.</p>

    <p>The last topic I was given advice on was to not worry too much about personal development. For me, I tend to worry that I am not doing enough or pushing myself enough at the detriment of enjoying the experience. I think for personal development there is a fine line between pushing yourself the perfect amount and pushing yourself too much. As I have become older (and I like to think wiser too), I've learned to take personal development in stride. I do not need to be taking on huge projects or live changes all the time. Rather, I need to work on tiny steps every day. This way, I continue to develop without stressing myself out about it.</p>

    <p>I feel like a strong person when I think about my values. It is important for me to stick by a strong set of beliefs to help me continue to learn. I definitely think values can help mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it. Values can keep you in line with your own goals and aspirations for yourself, rather than the stereotypes and expectations of others.</p>

    <p>At DBC, I think it will be important to communicate with my peers and the instructors if I feel like my work and day-to-day actions are not inline with my values. The most effective way for me to cope with feeling down is to communicate my feelings and why I think I'm feeling them. If I am able to do that during DBC, I think it will help me quickly identify the issues I'm facing and what I should change in my behavior to start feeling better faster. I've also already written out a list of the reasons why I am learning how to code and where I see myself in 6 months, so I think it will be helpful to reflect on that when I'm in the heat of the program to remind me why I decided to attend and become a driving force in the technology industry.</p>
