  <p><b>Pairing</b></p>
  <p>I have enjoyed pairing with others. At the beginning of the program, I was only focusing on completing the minimum pairing requirements. Now, I seek out pairing to not only complete the requirement, but also to learn from and meet my peers. The most rewarding part of pairing is when we both contribute parts to a solution, and together it works. Since if we were both working on the challenge separately, we both would have been held up in different parts. Together, however, we are able to complete the problem. The most frustrating part of pairing is when your partner is overbearing, and always thinks his/her answer is correct. In this situation, I do not feel like my knowledge or perspective is valued. In these cases, I force myself to be more assertive. Then, it doesn't feel like we're working together, but rather fighting each other on the correct solution. Overall, however, pairing has been an overwhelmingly positive experience.

  <p><b>Feedback</b></p>

  <p>
  I think it's always a little unnerving to read feedback, especially in an environment like Dev Bootcamp where we're all feeling more vulnerable in learning a new skill. I think my feedback was generally spot on: bubbly personality and work on this or that more. One of the main things I focus on in the pairing sessions is being really friendly and personable. I think that automatically builds trust and less axiety for both parties involved in the pairing session. The other aspect of the feedback I have received is to focus on learning specific aspects of ruby more, like ruby methods. I am working on this while working on the challenges this week. I also think everyone's still in the learning phase, so everyone can benefit from spending more time focusing on the fundamentals, including myself. I enjoy writing feedback. After the first few feedbacks submitted, I realized my feedback should be a bit longer and more actionable/specific. So I'm working on making my feedback more helpful for the receiving individual.
  </p>

  <p><b>Final Thoughts</b></p>
  <p>
  Overall, I have loved the pairing and feedback model. I already feel apart of the DBC community and my cohort from interacting with members of my cohort on Google Hangouts. It's helping me learn the material and compare my pace of learnings to other members of my cohort. I have enjoyed Phase 0 very much so far and am looking forward to getting onsite with everyone soon!
