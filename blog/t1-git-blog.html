  <h2>Git, Github and Version Control</h2>

    <h3>Git</h3>
    <p>
        Git is one of the most popular methods to keep track of your versions. The versions are stored locally on your computer. Git helps you keep track of these changes by taking a snapshot, or commit, every time you use the keyword, 'git commit.' 
    </p>
    <h3>GitHub</h3>
    <p>
        GitHub is used for collaborative version control because it houses the versions on the internet. This way, multiple people can work on the code base at the same time, because you always know which version is the master at a specific point in time. This is very important when you are working on a team. Without a tool like GitHub, it's significantly harder to keep track of the current master version of software because everyone is working off of their own local version on their own computer. 
    </p>
    <h3>Version Control</h3>
    <p>
        Version control is massively important when developing software. It stores each version and keeps track of every change. Also you have to provide notes for every change you make, so you can look back in the past to see quick shapshots of what you've changed. It also serves as a backup in case anything happens to you file. You can revert back to previous versions. Without version control, there would be no way to go back in time if you create a bug. Version control is essential in development.
