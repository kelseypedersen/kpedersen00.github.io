  <p><b>How you can use your understanding of your thinking style to your advantage at DBC to help you learn?</b></p>

  <p>I am a concreate random learning style. This means that I like experimenting to find answers, taking risks, using my intuition and solving problems independently. I learn best when I am able to use trial-and-error approaches, able to compete with others and given the opportunity to work through the problems by myself. It's hard on me when I have restrictions and limitations, formal reports, choosing only one answer and having no options.

  <p>I agree with these learning style generalizations for the most part. I left out the part that I have a hard tim with routines, re-doing anything once it's done and keeping detailed records since I think those are three of my greatest strengths so doesn't fit into my personal learning style.</p>

  <p>I can use my understanding of my learning style to understand that I like to have enough time on the exercises to be able to experiment with the answer. Even once I have found one way to pass the tests, I like to find one or two other ways to complete the same exercise. It's important to give myself time to do this.</p>

  <p><b>What has been the biggest struggle for you?</b></p>

  <p>The biggest struggle has been time management. I am working full-time during phase 0, which has been a good test in managing the time in my day. My commute is an hour each way so I work on the exercises in the morning and at night while on my commute. </p>

  <p><b>Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else?</b></p>

  <p>I think anyone in my situation would be feeling a bit overwhelmed in terms of managing both. I also like to feel like I have enough time on the exercises and do not want to have to rush. For the most part though, I think I do a good job of giving myself enough time at night and on the weekend to successfully complete the exercises. </p>

  <p><b>If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.</b></p>
<p> My new goal is to finish half the course work by Wednesday each week, so I feel like I have time at the end to go back and check my work and go through answers that I did not fully understand and want to review. I also need to focus on smaller steps, focus on specific tasks per day, rather than thinking I need to complete the entire weeks worth of work in one or two days. Overall, I think I'm doing a great job in managing all my obligations and learning a ton already!</p>
