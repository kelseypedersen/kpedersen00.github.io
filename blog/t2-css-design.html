  <div class="content">

 <b>Relative</b>: This positioning means that it's relative to itself. If you set an element to "position: relative" but no other positioning elements (top, left, bottom, right) - it will have no affect on the positioning. It would look the same to "position: static." Once you add a positioning element, like "bottom: 20px," it will shift it 20 pixels UP from where it would normally be.


  </div>

    <div class="content">

  <b>Absolute</b>: This allows you to position the element EXACTLY where you want it. This is useful if the element does not rely on the placement on any other elemetns on a webpage. You use the postioning attributes: top, left, bottom, right - to position the element.

  The main issue to consider when thinking about using absolute positioning is that it is not affecting by any other element, which is not always ideal. It can limit the flexibility of a site, e.g. on mobile or differently sized sites.

  </div>

    <div class="content">

<b>Fixed</b>: This position fixes the element to the browser itself, which means that it stays in the same position as you scroll down the page. It's not used that often because it can result in a bad user experience if the user is using the webpage from a non-standard sized browswer (e.g. mobile).
