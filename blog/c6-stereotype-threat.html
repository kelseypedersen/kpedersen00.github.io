<p><i>In your post, consider whether you can identify times when you have been impacted by it. If you have, how did it affect your achievement? What questions did you ask yourself? Did you feel it physically? If you don't think you've ever felt it, can you imagine how it would feel to? If you thought others were suffering from it, what could you do to help others in that situation? Can you identify ways to change your behavior or the environment you're in to make it more welcoming and reduce the impact of stereotype threat?

<p>For the past year, I have worked in technology sales - a male-dominated industry -in San Francisco. The presence of the stereotype that women are not technical is evident.
