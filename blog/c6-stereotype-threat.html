    Stereotype Threat

<div class="question">In your post, consider whether you can identify times when you have been impacted by it. If you have, how did it affect your achievement?</div>

<div class="answer">For the past year, I have worked in technology sales - a male-dominated industry -in San Francisco. One of the biggest stereotype threats to me is the idea that women are more risk averse and not willing to take the risk of starting their own company. I have a few ideas on companies that I would like to start, and I fear that if I do not act on these ideas, that I would be confirming these ideas.</div>

<div class="question">What questions did you ask yourself? </div>

<div class="answer">I have asked myself if I am cut out to found and run a company. Am I too passive? Too sensitive? Will men see me as a leader? I also tend to think before I act, whereas men tend to act and then think. I am trying to develop more of that type of personality to be able to maximize it in certain situations where I need to act as quickly as possible rather than stewing about a possible answer.</div>

<div class="question">Did you feel it physically? </div>

<div class="answer">In this case, no. I think it's more of an emotional toll. The only physical effect could maybe be from stress and experiencing nausea or an upset stomach, but I haven't experienced any of those symptoms myself.</div>

<div class="question">If you thought others were suffering from it, what could you do to help others in that situation? </div>

<div class="answer">I think women need to continue to lift up and support other women who are interested in starting their own companies. It's important to support and encourage any female you know in their journey to become an entrepreneur.</div>

<div class="question">Can you identify ways to change your behavior or the environment you're in to make it more welcoming and reduce the impact of stereotype threat? </div>

<div class="answer">The biggest environmental change the Bay Area needs is more female role models for entrepreneurs. It's hard for anyone to envision a female entrepreneurs because people believe all the super successful founders have been men, e.g. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg. Because of this, I want to show others that women can be successful leaders as well.</div>
