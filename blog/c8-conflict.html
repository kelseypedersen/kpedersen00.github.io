1. Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?

When I graduated from college in 2013, I wanted to move to Santiago, Chile to integrate myself in the StartUp Chile scene. I told my parents I wanted to move to South America and they immediately freaked out. "Is it safe?", "Where are you going to live?", "How are you going to afford it?". They baraded me with questions, many of which I didn't know the answer to. However, I did know that I wanted to explore South America before coming back to the United States.

2. What was the source of the conflict?

The main source of conflict was my parents not understanding why I wanted to move to South America. They thought I had come up with this idea on a whim and was not going to plan the move in advance. They were also concerned for my safety as a tall, blonde woman.

3. What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?

I immediately felt very angry with my parents: "Why didn't they understand!?", "Why are they limiting my actions?!", "Who are they to tell me I can't go?!". I was mad because I thought I had a great plan, and they flat out said they would not support the move.

4. What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?

I worked on brushing out more concrete details for the trip and one of my friends also decided to come along too. I also began networking and connecting with friends of friends who lived in Santiago, Chile. They were a helpful source of information in terms of housing, jobs, etc. I was able to share this with my parents, which eased their fears. Also, as I began to plan, my parents started to see I was serious about moving and was educating myself on the best way to successfully move to Santiago.

5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?

I would have presented more of a concrete plan from the get-go to my parents. I also should have been more understanding about their reaction, since they were only concerned about my well-being.

6. What did you learn from this experience?

I learned that in a conflict I should always think about how the other side is perceiving the conflict. For example, my parents were coming from the side of being concerned about my health, happiness and well-being, as most parents do. Whereas, I thought this would be a learning experience and fun adventure. My parents wanted me to think about different aspects of the move than what I was thinking about. From then on, I try to approach conflicts initially from the other side, and work my presentation and approach based off of that perspective rather than mine. This method has proven to reduce conflict right off the bat so I use it as frequently as possible now.
