    <p> This video has made me even more excited to begin Dev Bootcamp - if that's even possible! It's fun to hear about the early days of DBC, when people were hoping they didn't just quit their jobs for a program scam. I think the hustle, and the feeling of 'the program depends on the success' remains the same. I know I have that feeling of obligation going into it. I want to be an example of success at the end of the program.</p>
    <p> It's easy to go into the program, just accepting the support and curriculum put in place for all students. However, I want to go into the program thinking that this is my program and this is my time to learn and make amazing things. The idea of the creator mindset, the sense of that I can really do this, really stuck out to me. It is an mindset that I've had in other aspects of my life, like academics and sports, and I'm excited to apply that type of mindset for coding at Dev Bootcamp.</p>
    <p> I am looking forward to being in a cohort of similar disruptors. I'm excited to be part of an environment of people who have similar aspirations and goals. And the we all have the feeling, "we're in this together and make a amazing things together."</p>
